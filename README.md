## Catriona Bennett

After over 16 years in retail, it was time for a change. Having already done some work with HTML (self taught), I used to look after 3 websites and this combined with me being thorough in my work led to a close friend suggesting programming. On taking redundancy, I started teaching myself how to code. Initially with C# but quickly moved to Python, I was really enjoying it and loved seeing the code Iâ€™d written working! I attended Makers Academy to further my knowledge and help me get started on my new career path. Originally I thought my preference would be for frontend but as the course went on, I realised just how much I enjoy doing the logic etc, so now it's backend that I prefer!

I worked at Dunelm for over 2 1/2 years as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and am now looking for my next role. SRE was very demanding due to both working on SRE projects and being embedded in an engineering team. Although I enjoyed it, I realised that I wanted to focus on the engineering side of things, so I'm now looking for a Software Engineer/Developer role.

## Skills

#### Organised

Through my time in Stock Control at Tesco and being secretary of two clubs at the same time meant organisation was key for me to get everything done. Working in an organised and methodical manner comes naturally to me!

#### Good team worker

Being in Stock Control I worked in a small team but we had to work together as otherwise we wouldn't get everything done! I was my manager's right hand person for several years and quite often if my colleagues had a problem, they would come to me for help rather than my manager! Also, when at Makers and doing our final project, we had just 10 days to make a viable product. Working as team was one of the key elements to achieving this.

#### Adaptable

I'm very adaptable and during my time at Tesco, one minute I could be doing my work and the next having to help out on another department. After leaving Tesco, I did temp work and never knew from one week to the next what I'd be doing.
