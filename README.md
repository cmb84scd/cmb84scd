## Catriona Bennett

After over 16 years in retail, it was time for a change. Having already done some work with HTML (self taught), I used to look after 3 websites and this combined with me being thorough in my work led to a close friend suggesting programming. On taking redundancy, I started teaching myself how to code. Initially with C# but quickly moved to Python, I was really enjoying it and loved seeing the code Iâ€™d written working! I attended Makers Academy to further my knowledge and help me get started on my new career path. Originally I thought my preference would be for frontend but as the course went on, I've realised just how much I enjoy doing the logic etc, so now it's backend that I prefer!

## Skills

#### Organised

Through my time in Stock Control at Tesco and being secretary of two clubs at the same time meant organisation was key for me to get everything done. Working in an organised and methodical manner comes naturally to me!

#### Good team worker

Being in Stock Control I worked in a small team but we had to work together as otherwise we wouldn't get everything done! I was my manager's right hand person for several years and quite often if my colleagues had a problem, they would come to me for help rather than my manager! Also, when at Makers and doing our final project, we had just 10 days to make a viable product. Working as team was one of the key elements to achieving this.

#### Adaptable

I'm very adaptable and during my time at Tesco, one minute I could be doing my work and the next having to help out on another department. After leaving Tesco, I did temp work and never knew from one week to the next what I'd be doing.

## Experience

**Web Developer** (2005 - present)
As I previously mentioned, I used to look after 3 websites and these belonged to 3 different dance groups. In each case I took them over from someone else, so they were already established and I just had to keep them up to date. 2 of the websites were originally in word and I redid both in HTML, though not at the same time! The third was redone by someone else and I learnt a lot from seeing their code, which helped me improve the ones I was working on. In redoing 2 of the websites I discovered just how much extra stuff Word adds to a document that isn't needed. I'd already stripped a load out of the first site I was redoing, when I saw what had been done on the third one and realised I could take out even more. So I went back to the first one and did just that! The two that I redid were just very basic HTML and CSS, which I learnt as I went along.

**Dance Teacher** (September 2011 - present)
- For the first 2 years I would take a Scottish Dance class if the regular teacher was unavailable for any reason. In September 2013 I took over the beginners class and taught it every week that it ran, until December 2018 when the classes merged. While teaching this class, and since then, I occasionally take evenings for other clubs.
- It should be noted in all cases I am teaching adults and if children are present, their parents/guardians are also present.

**The Best Connection** (September 2019 to March 2020)    
*Retail assistant (agency staff)*

**Tesco** (March 2003 to May 2019)   
*Stock Controller*  
- Used a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to manage stock and I usually ended up being the one fixing them! Usually this just entailed me doing different types of reboots and if these didn't work, then I would report them by phoning the helpdesk so that they could be swapped out. I trained colleagues on how to use the new machines when they were upgraded as well as aiding them to put the company's staff apps on their phones.
- My job involved counting stock, cubing products, printing missing shelf edge labels, re-merchandising where necessary, mapping and investigating stock levels. So essentially I was trouble shooting internal hardware to manage stock and supporting the use of internal hardware.
- I was also the team lead and manager when required. When this happened I would be looking after 3-6 staff and delegate work when required.
